# TiFrame

## A simple single-threaded OpenGL framework using ImGui.

For learning more about engine development I started a personal project to create a very basic framework. Currently the framework consists of three managers: a drawmanager, a UI manager and a entity-component system manager. I also added a couple of basic UI elements, like a file browser, a scene inspector etc.

I wrote everything in the engine, from start to end, including the math library for vector and matrix calculations. Feel free to use this framework for reference and personal development.
